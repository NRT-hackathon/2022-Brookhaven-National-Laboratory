## Paper Abstract
The effectiveness of an instrumentâ€™s autofocus method is a critical consideration during microscopy imaging. Typically, there are hardware components available to increase this accuracy, but these rely on the sensor's capability to perform in the field. Deep learning methods have been broadly adopted for automatic analysis of images for various image learning tasks. In this report, we develop a machine learning workflow automating the prediction of the distance to the focal plane of microscopy images. Incorporating edge detection and transfer learning, our machine learning workflow achieves rapid, highly accurate prediction on images with high edge area percentage with little computational resource requirement.
